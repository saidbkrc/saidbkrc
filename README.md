    I graduated from Karatay University, Department of Energy Management. I took business courses at Coimbra ISCAC in Portugal.
For various reasons, I could not find a job related to the department I studied and I decided to learn software. With the help of my sister, I developed myself in php and codeigniter. I worked on my own for about 9 months. Then I started to work as a backend developer in pigasoft and I have been working for more than 1 year. Thank you.
